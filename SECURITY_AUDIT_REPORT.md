# GitPlus Security Audit Report
**Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Auditor:** Claude Security & Compliance Specialist  
**Scope:** Path Traversal Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation  

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the GitPlus codebase to address critical path traversal vulnerabilities. **All identified high-severity security issues have been resolved** through the implementation of robust path security controls, comprehensive input validation, and defense-in-depth measures.

### Risk Assessment
- **Before Remediation:** HIGH RISK - Multiple critical path traversal vulnerabilities
- **After Remediation:** LOW RISK - Comprehensive security controls implemented

## Critical Vulnerabilities Identified and Resolved

### 1. **CRITICAL: toolHandler.ts Path Validation Bypass (Lines 71-72)**
**Risk Level:** Critical  
**Description:** Basic `fs.stat()` check without canonicalization allowed `../` sequences and symlink traversal.

**Remediation:**
- Implemented comprehensive `validateGitPath()` security validation
- Added canonical path resolution with `path.resolve()`
- Integrated symlink detection and prevention
- Added repository boundary enforcement
- Implemented security logging for all path access attempts

### 2. **HIGH: git/client.ts Insufficient Input Validation (Line 34)**
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** Regex patterns only blocked some traversal attempts, allowing sophisticated bypass techniques.

**Remediation:**
- Enhanced dangerous pattern detection with comprehensive regex sets
- Added null byte injection prevention
- Implemented control character filtering
- Added working directory security validation on all git operations
- Integrated cross-platform path security validation

### 3. **HIGH: Missing Symlink Traversal Prevention**
**Risk Level:** High  
**Description:** No validation against symlink-based directory traversal attacks.

**Remediation:**
- Implemented symlink detection using `fs.lstat()`
- Added configurable symlink policies (strict/moderate/permissive)
- Canonical path validation to prevent symlink-based escapes
- Repository boundary enforcement for all symlink targets

### 4. **MEDIUM: Constructor Path Validation**
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Description:** GitClient constructor accepted any path without validation.

**Remediation:**
- Added lazy security validation on first git operation
- Implemented `validateWorkingDirectory()` method
- Added canonical path updates for validated directories
- Integrated security warning logging

## Security Controls Implemented

### Path Security Utility (`src/utils/pathSecurity.ts`)
A comprehensive security framework providing:

1. **Multi-Level Security Validation**
   - STRICT: Maximum security for production environments
   - MODERATE: Balanced security for development
   - PERMISSIVE: Basic validation with warnings

2. **Path Canonicalization**
   - `path.resolve()` for absolute path resolution
   - Symlink resolution with `fs.realpath()`
   - Cross-platform path normalization

3. **Dangerous Pattern Detection**
   - Directory traversal sequences (`../`, `..\\`)
   - Null byte injection (`\0`)
   - Control characters (`\x00-\x1f`)
   - Shell metacharacters (`;&|$(){}[]<>`)
   - Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, AUX, etc.)
   - Command injection patterns

4. **Repository Boundary Enforcement**
   - Relative path calculation with `path.relative()`
   - Validation that targets stay within repository bounds
   - Multi-root support for complex repository structures

5. **Cross-Platform Security**
   - Windows-specific validations (UNC paths, reserved names)
   - Unix-specific protections (/proc, /sys access)
   - Platform-agnostic dangerous patterns

6. **Security Logging and Monitoring**
   - Structured security event logging
   - Configurable log levels (INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL)
   - Attack attempt detection and reporting
   - Log rotation and size management

### Enhanced GitClient Security
1. **Pre-Operation Validation**
   - Working directory validation before any git command
   - Custom working directory validation for operations
   - Security state tracking to avoid redundant validation

2. **Argument Sanitization**
   - Enhanced dangerous pattern detection
   - Context-aware validation (command, filepath, message)
   - Length validation to prevent buffer overflow attacks
   - Path traversal prevention in file arguments

3. **Spawn-Based Command Execution**
   - Complete shell injection protection
   - Argument array separation (no string concatenation)
   - Timeout protection against DoS attacks

### ToolHandler Security Integration
1. **Request-Level Validation**
   - Security validation before any MCP tool execution
   - Comprehensive error messages with security context
   - Canonical path enforcement for all repository operations

2. **Security-First Error Handling**
   - Detailed security violation reporting
   - Remediation guidance in error messages
   - Security event logging for audit trails

## Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Security Test Suite
- **Path Traversal Protection:** 20+ test scenarios covering various attack vectors
- **Symlink Security:** Cross-platform symlink attack prevention
- **Repository Boundary Enforcement:** Validation of access controls
- **Cross-Platform Security:** Windows and Unix-specific attack prevention
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end security validation with GitClient and ToolHandler

### Test Coverage Areas
1. Basic directory traversal attempts (`../../../etc/passwd`)
2. Null byte injection attacks
3. Control character injection
4. Symlink-based traversal
5. Repository boundary violations
6. System directory access prevention
7. Windows reserved name blocking
8. Security logging functionality
9. Multi-level security configuration
10. Error handling and recovery
