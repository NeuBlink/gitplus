            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage
            
            Be constructive and helpful in your feedback.
            
            **IMPORTANT**: After completing your review, save your COMPLETE review output to a file:
            
            ```bash
            # Save your entire review output to file (copy everything you just wrote above)
            cat > /tmp/claude-review-analysis.md << 'EOF'
            [PASTE YOUR COMPLETE REVIEW OUTPUT HERE - INCLUDING ALL DETAILS, ANALYSIS, FINDINGS, RECOMMENDATIONS, EVERYTHING YOU WROTE ABOVE]
            EOF
            ```
            
            **Critical**: The file must contain your FULL review - all code analysis, security findings, performance notes, recommendations, concerns, approvals, everything. Do not summarize or shorten it. The merge decision needs your complete analysis.
